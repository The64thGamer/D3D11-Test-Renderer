# D3D11 Project

A project I worked on in college for creating a 3D renderer from scratch. This was built up over the course of 3 months, and I had to hit multiple render targets for the final scene:
* Transparent Objects
* Point Lights & Spot Lights
* Specular Lighting
* Multiple Models
* Moving / Rotating Models
* Skybox
